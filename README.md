# Goals for this project were:
## Phase A
- Determine whether a vertex is inside the mesh or not <br />
## Phase B
- Redistribute vertices so that they are closer to their neighbors <br />
- Redistribute vertices so that they are closer to the link that has been defined as their interior <br />
## Phase C
- Determine if a vertex is 'beach-facing' and what it's closest neighbors are <br />
- Smooth a mesh by tucking/untucking its border vertices <br />
- Smooth a loop using a cubic predictor method <br />
